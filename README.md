# Adam Turner | Software Engineer Portfolio

This is my portfolio website, built with Next.js. It holds information about me, my projects, and a way to contact me.

I am not currently looking for new opportunities, but I am always open to discussing potential collaborations or projects.

Feel free to take a look around and get in touch if you would like to work together!
